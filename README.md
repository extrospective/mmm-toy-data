# MMM Toy Data

## For Robyn

### Data Sets

Run a script in Jupyter notebook to create output data sets.

* MMMToyDataSetOnePaidVar.ipynb: creates a data set with one paid variable
* MMMToyDataSetTwoPaidVar.ipynb: creates a data set with two paid variables

The data sets created by these two files are in the data directory so users do not have to recreate.

### Execution

* robyn_toy_script.R: script to execute using a toy data set


## For VAR

* PoisonToy.ipynb was created for VAR in order to determine how it would measure the impact of poison

The data sets created by this are not in the data directory due to the size of some.
